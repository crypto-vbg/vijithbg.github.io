# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a single-page portfolio website with a deep-space exploration theme. The portfolio features an immersive 3D starfield background, an animated black hole centerpiece, and futuristic UI elements using glassmorphism and neon accents. The website showcases professional work through interactive sections including hero, about, projects, skills, and contact areas.
